                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.

                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.
