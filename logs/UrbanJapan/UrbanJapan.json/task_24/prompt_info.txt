                        # Search Area
                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-26, 75]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [75, 176]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = tall buildings, illuminated signs; construction crane in the background; wet street with parked cars  
                        Left = high-rise building, lit windows; construction crane on the left; red car driving on the road  
                        Right = building facade, shadowed; metal railing in the foreground; light coming from the right  
                        Down = motorcycle, green body; person lying on the ground; damaged pavement; dumpster nearby

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is **Bicycle**, described as: Slim, two-wheeled frame with a pastel green exterior, upright handlebars and a black saddle, vintage city bike design with thin tires and step-through frame.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
