                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-17, 84]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-26, 75]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = wooden pallets, stacked; five pallets; pallets are in the foreground; pallets arranged in a row  
                        Left = blue and white cat, resting; cat is in the foreground; cat positioned on the left side  
                        Right = black background, dark; no objects visible  
                        Down = black object, small; object is in the foreground; object positioned on the left side

                        - The target is **Chair**, described as: Simple, plastic chair with a curved backrest and slatted design, light grey exterior, common for outdoor or patio use.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:4 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
