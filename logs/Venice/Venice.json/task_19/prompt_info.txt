                        Size: small(1.5*0.75=1.13 squares),
                        Description: Geometric rectangular structure, reddish-brown wooden surface with beveled edges, mounted on small wheels, functional design suited for writing or computing tasks.]

                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [41, 142]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-59, 42]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = multi-story building, beige facade; arched windows; bridge in the foreground; canal running through the middle  
                        Left = building facade, beige color; arched windows; bridge visible to the left; canal in the background  
                        Right = square building, pink facade; green shutters; large tree with yellow leaves; canal and bridge in the background  
                        Down = canal water, dark surface; building facade on the left; stairs leading down to the water; railing along the stairs

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** Desk**, described as:  Geometric rectangular structure, reddish-brown wooden surface with beveled edges, mounted on small wheels, functional design suited for writing or computing tasks.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
