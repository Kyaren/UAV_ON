                        Target = [Name: Umbrella,
                        Size: big(8*8=64 squares),
                        Description: Geometric octagonal canopy, alternating red and white fabric segments with taut stitching, thin central pole structure, designed for providing shade.]

                        # Search Area
                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-25, 76]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-20, 81]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = yellow tree, large, leafy; tree is in the center; red-tiled roofs surrounding  
                        Left = red brick building, tall, textured; yellow tree, large, leafy; tree is in the background; building is in the foreground  
                        Right = brown building, multiple windows, shuttered; orange roof, tiled; tree with orange leaves, large; tree is to the right of the building  
                        Down = staircase, curved, stone; orange roof, tiled; staircase leads upward; roof is above the staircase

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** Umbrella**, described as:  Geometric octagonal canopy, alternating red and white fabric segments with taut stitching, thin central pole structure, designed for providing shade.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
