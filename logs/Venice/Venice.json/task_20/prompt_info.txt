                        Target = [Name: WaterBottle,
                        Size: small(0.25*0.25=0.06 squares),
                        Description: Geometric cylindrical shape, semi-transparent blue plastic body with dark cap, minimal markings, likely used for holding and drinking water.]

                        # Search Area
                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [46, 147]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-83, 18]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = buildings, beige and pink; canal in the middle; bridge over the canal; buildings on both sides  
                        Left = building wall, beige; six windows; windows are arched  
                        Right = tree, large, yellow leaves; tree is in the foreground; buildings in the background  
                        Down = alleyway, narrow; building walls on both sides; railing on the right side

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** WaterBottle**, described as:  Geometric cylindrical shape, semi-transparent blue plastic body with dark cap, minimal markings, likely used for holding and drinking water.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:8 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
