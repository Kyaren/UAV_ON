                        Target = [Name: Plate,
                        Size: small(0.5*0.5=0.25 squares),
                        Description: Geometric circular form, smooth metallic surface, dull gray finish with shallow curvature, used as a flat base for holding items or serving food.]

                        # Search Area
                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [9, 110]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [31, 132]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = yellow building, multiple windows, shutters closed; red-tiled roof; clothesline with orange garment; blue sky in the background  
                        Left = yellow building, arched windows, balconies; black shutters; reflection effect distorts view; clear sky above  
                        Right = white building, red-tiled roof, green shutters; pink building adjacent; floating geometric shapes in the foreground; clear sky  
                        Down = narrow alley, high walls, shadows cast; clotheslines across buildings; view from below looking up; sunlight on the ground

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** Plate**, described as:  Geometric circular form, smooth metallic surface, dull gray finish with shallow curvature, used as a flat base for holding items or serving food.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
