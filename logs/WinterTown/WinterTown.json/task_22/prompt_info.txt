                        - The target is ** SignPost**, described as:  Narrow vertical post with a single horizontal arrow board, rusted metal texture with directional point, used for wayfinding or indicating direction.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:110 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.

                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-67, 34]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-79, 22]

                        Right = snow-covered trees, white branches; trees are in the background; buildings on the right  
                        Down = tree shadow, cast on the ground; tree with green leaves in the top right corner
