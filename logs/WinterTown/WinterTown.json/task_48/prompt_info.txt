                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):

                        Front = building, yellowish facade, broken windows; building occupies the right side; shadows of two people on the snow  
                        Left = snow-covered ground, white and untouched; wooden fence running horizontally across the middle; trees in the background  
                        Right = building facade, beige with dark patches; two windows with dirty glass; window frames are brown wood  
                        Down = building facade, beige with dark patches; multiple windows with dirty glass; perspective is from below looking up

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** Piano**, described as:  Rectangular upright shape, dark wooden texture with ornate side carvings, visible keyboard section and foot pedals, designed for musical performance.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:55 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
