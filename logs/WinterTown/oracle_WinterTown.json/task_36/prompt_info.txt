                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-234, -133]

                        Left = pine trees, green needles; trees are in the foreground and background; snow-covered ground with a path  
                        Right = pine trees, green needles; trees are in the background; snow-covered slope  
                        Down = pine tree branches, green needles; branches are at the top left corner; textured gray background

                        - The target is ** FoodCan**, described as:  Cylindrical shape, metallic texture with colorful label, smooth surface with sealed top, consistent with preserved food container.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:102 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
