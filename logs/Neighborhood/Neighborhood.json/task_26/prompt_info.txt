                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:19 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.

                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-300, -199]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-9, 92]

                        Front = trees, dense foliage, green leaves; sunlight filtering through; trees surround the area  
                        Left = tree branches, dark shadows, sparse leaves; light source from above; branches spread across the frame  
                        Right = trees, scattered arrangement, green leaves; sunlight in the background; trees cast shadows on the ground  
                        Down = leaves, shadowed, green color; light source from above; leaves partially cover the view
