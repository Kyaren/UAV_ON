                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-212, -111]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-89, 12]

                        Right = staircase, metal railing, ascending; staircase is in the foreground; wall in the background  
                        Down = wall, textured surface, dark color; wall is in the foreground; corner in the background

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is **Racecar**, described as: Geometric streamlined form, sky blue painted metal body with black wheels and exposed exhaust pipes, open cockpit with single seat, designed for high-speed track performance.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
