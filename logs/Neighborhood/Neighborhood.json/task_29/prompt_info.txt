                        - The target is **Cart**, described as: Geometric wheeled cart with attached circular canopy, silver metallic body with printed food images, blue and yellow fabric umbrella marked "SNACKS", intended for mobile street vending.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:42 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
