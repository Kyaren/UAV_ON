                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:7 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.

                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-278, -177]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-305, -204]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = trees, dense foliage, green leaves; trees are in the foreground and background; sunlight filtering through branches  
                        Left = houses, wooden structure, brown color; houses are in the middle ground; cars parked near houses; trees surrounding houses  
                        Right = tree, large size, green leaves; tree is in the background; house partially visible behind tree; clear sky above  
                        Down = grass, green color, short blades; grass covers the ground; picnic table with umbrella in the center; hedge on the left side
