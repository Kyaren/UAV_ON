                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-245, -144]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-84, 17]

                        Front = house, gray roof, brick walls; house is in the foreground; red bench near the house; umbrella on the lawn  
                        Left = street, asphalt road; houses with gray roofs; trees lining the street; power lines above the street  
                        Right = garage, brown roof, brick walls; garage is in the foreground; red car parked near the garage; trees in the background  
                        Down = truck, yellow body, open bed; truck is in the foreground; boxes and crates near the truck; dumpster nearby

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is **Dumpster**, described as: Geometric rectangular form, dark green metal body with black hinged lid, surface shows wear and rust streaks, used for temporary waste storage.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:39 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
