                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:51 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.

                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [13, 114]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [-312, -211]

                        Left = trees, green leaves, along a pathway; pathway in the foreground; street lamp to the left  
                        Right = paved road, straight, with white lines; trees on both sides; street lamp on the left; grass patches between trees  
                        Down = street lamp, black, casting shadow; tree branches overhead; shadows on the ground; view from above
