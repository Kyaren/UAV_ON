                        Target = [Name: ElectricBox,  
                        Size: small(0.75*0.5=0.38 squares),  
                        Description: Rectangular, upright metal structure with a flat top, weathered yellow exterior with visible rust and dirt, typical of an outdoor electrical utility box.]

                        # Search Area Constraint  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D range:  
                        X Range: [-37, 64]  
                        Y Range: [-38, 63]

                        # RGB Captions  
                        Front: green street sign, illuminated; tall building, dark facade; building partially obstructs view; street in the background  
                        Left: cityscape, multiple buildings; illuminated windows; traffic light, red signal; street with lane markings; construction crane in the distance  
                        Right: dark silhouette, indistinct features; faint blue grid pattern; black background; silhouette occupies central area  
                        Down: concrete steps, wet surface; metal railing, vertical bars; light source, bright illumination; shadow cast on steps

                        # Mission Instructions  
                        - Your goal is to find and stop near the correct object: ElectricBox.  
                        - You are flying at a fixed low altitude — you must never ascend or descend. These actions are invalid.
                        - If any caption mentions the object name and matches at least one trait in the description (e.g., material, shape), and depth > 4.0, you must move toward that direction.

                        - After moving, if the same direction still shows the object name and matches the description, and depth < 20.0, you must stop immediately by returning [stop, 0].  
                        - Do not pass by or delay once the target is clearly confirmed in view.

                        - If no caption mentions the target, move in the direction (front, left, or right) with the highest semantic similarity and safe depth.  
                        - Avoid directions with depth < 2.0 — treat as obstacles.

                        # Exploration Rules  
                        - If all directions are shallow (depth < 3.0), you may rotate once to find a new direction.  
                        - If no forward progress in the last 3 steps, you may rotate once, but never ascend.  
                        - Prefer moving into unexplored space. Avoid repeating paths or spinning in place.

                        # Rotation Restrictions  
                        - Never perform two consecutive rotations (rotl or rotr).  
                        - After any rotation, your next action must be forward, left, or right.  
                        - Never rotate more than once within any 2-step window.

                        # Step Size Guidance  
                        - If all directions > 15 → use large step (6.0–8.0)  
                        - If all directions < 10 → use small step (2.0–3.0)  
                        - If only one safe direction → use step 2.0–4.0

                        # Stop Logic (Early Termination)  
                        - If StepsSoFar : 0 > 100, and one caption partially match the object with safe depth (< 20.0), you may also stop.

                        # Output Format

                        You must return exactly one valid Python-style list.  
                        Example: [forward, 6.0]

                        # Valid Action Types

                        - [forward, distance], [left, distance], [right, distance] → distance ∈ [2.0, 8.0]  
                        - [rotl, angle], [rotr, angle] → angle ∈ [15, 60]  
                        - [stop, 0] → Use only if the target is visually confirmed and depth < 20.0

                        Do not use [ascend, x] or [descend, x] — these actions are forbidden. You are flying at a fixed altitude.

                        # Format Rules

                        Do not output:
                        - Quoted lists like '[forward, 6.0]' or "['forward', '6.0']"  
                        - Any string-wrapped output  
                        - Any newline characters or extra formatting  
                        - Any explanation — just return a single valid list
