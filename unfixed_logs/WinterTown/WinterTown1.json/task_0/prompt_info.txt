                        - The target is ** Apple**, described as:  Organic round shape, red glossy surface with subtle stem detail, smooth skin and small size, consistent with edible fruit.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:0 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
                        - Compare the captions of **Front**, **Left**, and **Right**: choose the direction whose caption best matches the target’s description.  

                        # Output Format Reminder  
                        - Your output must follow the format: `[action_type, value]`  
                        - Only one action should be returned per step.  
                        - Do **not** output explanations, text, or JSON — just one list-formatted string.

                        **Action types and recommended ranges:**  
                        - [forward, distance], [left, distance], [right, distance] 
                            → Horizontal movement, **distance ∈ [1.0, 10.0]**

                        - [ascend, distance], [descend, distance]  
                            → Vertical movement, **distance ∈ [0.5, 3.0]**

                        - [rotl, angle], [rotr, angle]  
                            → Rotation, **angle ∈ [5, 90]**

                        - [stop, 0]  
                            → Stop only if you are sure the target is within **20 units** and clearly visible.
                        - Choose a **longer distance** (e.g., 7–10) when the front direction is clear and wide.
                        - Choose a **shorter distance** (e.g., 1–3) when the caption indicates the target is nearby, or when close to obstacles.
                        - Avoid always choosing the same value. Your step size should reflect how confidently you can move forward.

                            → Stop only if you are sure the target is within **20 units** and clearly visible.
                        - Choose a **longer distance** (e.g., 7–10) when the front direction is clear and wide.
                        - Choose a **shorter distance** (e.g., 1–3) when the caption indicates the target is nearby, or when close to obstacles.
                        - Avoid always choosing the same value. Your step size should reflect how confidently you can move forward.

                        Target = [Name: Apple,
                        Size: small(0.25*0.25=0.06 squares),
                        Description: Organic round shape, red glossy surface with subtle stem detail, smooth skin and small size, consistent with edible fruit.]

                        # Search Area
                        All positions are represented as 3D coordinates in the format: **(x, y, z)**  
                        You must strictly stay within the following 2D navigation boundary (horizontal plane):
                        **X Range**: [min_x, max_x] = [-99, 2]  
                        **Y Range**: [min_y, max_y] = [91, 192]

                        # RGB Captions
                        Front = building, stone facade; multiple windows; one light on in the bottom window; building occupies most of the frame  
                        Left = two trees, tall and leafless; brick building with green balcony; trees are in the foreground; building in the background  
                        Right = snowy landscape; metal bed frames; pine tree; sun low in the sky; bed frames in the foreground; tree slightly left of center  
                        Down = shadow of a bench on snow; illuminated square light source at top left; shadow occupies the lower half of the image

                        # Reminder  
                        - The target is ** Apple**, described as:  Organic round shape, red glossy surface with subtle stem detail, smooth skin and small size, consistent with edible fruit.  
                        - Compare the target description with all RGB captions (Front, Left, Right, Down).  
                        - The goal is to **explore the environment** and get **visually close to the target** before deciding to stop.  
                        - Do not rotate repeatedly. If you rotated in the last step, prioritize moving instead.  
                        - If any caption strongly matches the target name or description (e.g., object type, shape, color, function), and the visual evidence suggests that the object is **close and clearly visible**, you may consider stopping.  
                        - Avoid stopping immediately after a weak or partial match. Keep moving until the evidence is **strong and consistent**.  
                        - Stopping too early on a vague match is a **mission failure**. It's better to get closer and confirm than to stop prematurely.  
                        - **If StepsSoFar:3 is more than 100 steps**, and the target seems to match any current caption reasonably well, you may relax your stopping condition and consider stopping based on a **single strong match**.
                        - Compare the captions of **Front**, **Left**, and **Right**: choose the direction whose caption best matches the target’s description.  

                        # Output Format Reminder  
                        - Your output must follow the format: `[action_type, value]`  
                        - Only one action should be returned per step.  
                        - Do **not** output explanations, text, or JSON — just one list-formatted string.

                        **Action types and recommended ranges:**  
                        - [forward, distance], [left, distance], [right, distance] 
                            → Horizontal movement, **distance ∈ [1.0, 10.0]**

                        - [ascend, distance], [descend, distance]  
                            → Vertical movement, **distance ∈ [0.5, 3.0]**

                        - [rotl, angle], [rotr, angle]  
                            → Rotation, **angle ∈ [5, 90]**

                        - [stop, 0]  
                            → Stop only if you are sure the target is within **20 units** and clearly visible.
                        - Choose a **longer distance** (e.g., 7–10) when the front direction is clear and wide.
                        - Choose a **shorter distance** (e.g., 1–3) when the caption indicates the target is nearby, or when close to obstacles.
                        - Avoid always choosing the same value. Your step size should reflect how confidently you can move forward.
